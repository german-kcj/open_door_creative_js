## The Editor

In this section, we'll explain the environment you will be working on to create the Emoji Race. p5js has a very convenient place for us to write, test, and preview our code, it is the p5js Editor as seen in the image above. You can think of the Editor as a smart Word document that knows about JavaScript and p5js.

* Open a new project in the p5js [editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).

Time to define the components of the p5js editor:

#### Preview :yellow\_circle: <a href="#preview" id="preview"></a>

The Preview window is the place where the result of our code appears. It is our code executed by p5js.

#### Sketch :green\_circle: <a href="#sketch" id="sketch"></a>

This is the place where we write code! As you will see, all applications in p5js start with some code in this document. We'll go over the current content of the sketch area in another section.

#### Console :blue\_circle: <a href="#console" id="console"></a>

Here we will get important messages that the editor has for us, in some cases as part of an instruction we provided to test the functionality of the application, and some other times as errors and warnings about the integrity of our code. The Console is an essential part of testing and solving issues (debugging) of our applications.

#### Menu Bar :red\_circle: <a href="#menu-bar" id="menu-bar"></a>

It contains on the top part, different ways for us to save, share, modify and configure our editor, as well as the option to Log in. The bottom part of the Menu, has two very important buttons, the Play, to run our code and the Stop, to stop it.

How can we learn more about all the different components used in p5js? Simple, we'll use the **Reference Library.**&#x20;
